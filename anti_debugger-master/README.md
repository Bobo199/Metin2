# Anti debugging vs Engineering Inverse
Anti Debugging in Client


Simple process review code against Debuggers for customers.

There are more debug methods, however this is the most usual, the only thing that reviews is if the current executable (our binary) contains the open debug port and if it does, it closes the program, in case of not finding a port of moment but is in process, analyze and check if there is the famous "Engine" online.

I advise not to create so many threads, if you have already created a thread to review the function attached and skip the thread.

Many of the Cheats use debug technicians to inject, blah, blah, blah.

If you need to fix more debug methods you can tell me and I can give you an approximate code.
